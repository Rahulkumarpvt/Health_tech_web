## Introduction
This project is a web-based platform that enables doctors, patients, and labs to access health reports at one place.  
Medico has the potential to streamline healthcare operations and improve patient outcomes. This website has been designed to have three distinct sections, catering to the specific needs of patients, doctors, and labs. The platform allows doctors to view and manage the health reports of their patients, patients to access their own health reports, and labs to upload the health reports. 

## Features
The following are the main features of the platform:

#### Patient Section:  
The patient section of the website is intended to provide a centralized location for patients to view and manage their health records. Patients can access their health status and health reports in one place, allowing them to keep track of their progress over time. The platform enables patients to have full control over their records, which can be shared with healthcare providers as required. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, ensuring that patients can easily navigate and access the information they need. They can view their own health reports, download them, share them with their doctors and also be able to add family members.          

#### Doctor Section:   
For doctors, the website provides a reliable and efficient way to access patient lab reports. By entering the patient's unique id, doctors can view the available reports and make an accurate diagnosis. The system has been designed to provide doctors with the tools they need to manage patient care effectively. The platform enables doctors to retrieve essential data quickly, allowing them to make informed decisions about patient care. A facial recognition login system has been implemented to enhance the security and authenticity of the login process for doctors. The use of facial recognition technology ensures that only authorized personnel can access the website's doctor section, providing an additional layer of security to protect sensitive patient information.      

#### Lab Section:   
The lab section of the website enables different labs to upload patient reports by unique id. This feature ensures that lab reports are stored safely and are accessible to authorized personnel only. The website has been designed with advanced security protocols, ensuring that patient data remains confidential at all times. This feature reduces the risk of data breaches, ensuring that sensitive patient information remains secure.      


The website's primary goal is to provide a common platform for managing all health-related issues in a single place. By providing a centralized location for patients, doctors, and labs to manage their health records, the website simplifies the process of accessing and sharing critical medical data. This feature is particularly beneficial for patients who need to access medical care from multiple healthcare providers.Also during emergencies, doctors can easily access a patient's data using their unique ID.

Overall, the development of this website represents a significant milestone in healthcare technology. The website has the potential to improve patient outcomes and streamline healthcare operations. By providing a centralized location for managing health records, the website simplifies the process of accessing and sharing critical medical data. The website's advanced security protocols ensure that patient data remains confidential, reducing the risk of data breaches.
